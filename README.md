# home-k8s

I am currently in the process of setting up my on-prem [homelab](https://github.com/samjtro/homelab). This repo is for building out the scripts I need to bootstrap k8s using kubeadm with as little extra weight as possible.

My goal with this is to get it as close as possible to a production bootstrap, to then build on top of it for production environments later.
