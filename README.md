# home-k8s

This repo is a guided install of k8s on-prem using kubeadm. It's purpose is for use in [homelab](https://github.com/samjtro/homelab), in order to create clusters at-home in a similar environment to which you might see at a production level. This means cutting out all of the fluff most other home k8s variants include. The goal of this project is to sharpen my skills with k8s by managing a cluster at home, and I will be adding more to this repo as I continue adding more utilities, scripts & yaml files.
