# home-k8s

My goal with [homelab](https://github.com/samjtro/homelab) is to create a multi-node k8s cluster with VMs for deployments, that replicates in most respects a typical cloud-native environment. I am hoping to achieve ultra high-availability clustering with some configuration, which will be done here. All of the typical homelab server stuff will be located @ [homelab](https://github.com/samjtro/homelab).

The end-goal is to sharpen my kubernetes skills and get job-ready for cloud-native.
